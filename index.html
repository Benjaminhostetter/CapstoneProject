Project Proposal for Capstone Project.

I'm thinking that I'd like to create my Music Academy website for my Capstone Project.

This would include:

1.  A Full Platform for hosting my 27 week Piano Curriculum.  
2.  Different 'Modules' for people to check off as they progress throughout the program.
3.  It would look/feel similar to Springboard and how springboard hosts their curriculum.
4.  It would allow people to login to their accounts and save progress to where they're at in the curriculum.
5.  I would also include the game I'm working on: Cosmic Keys, as an addition to this project.
6.  I'd like people to be able to play the game, check off the modules, and work throughout the program.
7.  I'd also like them to be able to set their weekly goal, just like in Springboard, and then have a place where they can have access to their Meetings with their Mentor.

I hope this would get approved!
